// 1. Previously, weâ€™ve made equality assertions with toBe(). 
// However, toBe() does a strict equality check, which would fail here. 
// The toEqual() assertion method, by contrast, checks for deep object equality. 
// So the assertion expect(x).toEqual(['madam']) passes as long as x is an array with the string "madam" as its only entry.
