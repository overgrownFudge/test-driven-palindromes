1. Previously, weâ€™ve made equality assertions with toBe(). 
However, toBe() does a strict equality check, which would fail here. 
The toEqual() assertion method, by contrast, checks for deep object equality. 
So the assertion expect(x).toEqual(['madam']) passes as long as x is an array 
with the string "madam" as its only entry.
